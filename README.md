# Stable Diffusion Web UI Forge

Stable Diffusion Web UI Forge is a platform on top of [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) to make development easier, and optimize the speed and resource consumption.

The name "Forge" is inspired from "Minecraft Forge". This project will become SD WebUI's Forge.

Forge will give you:

1. Improved optimization. (Fastest speed and minimal memory use among all alternative software.)
2. Patchable UNet and CLIP objects. (Developer-friendly platform.)

You can see that:

(1) Forge does not change WebUI results. Installing Forge is not a seed breaking change. Also, we do not change any UI.
